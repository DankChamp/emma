Speaker - offline text-to-speech, "just on my computer".

Emma speaks with a natural, feminine voice through Piper, a small neural
TTS engine that runs entirely on the CPU with no network calls:

  - Piper (preferred)  -> neural voices that actually sound human. Ships a
                          curated feminine default ("Amy"). Fully offline;
                          the voice model is a local .onnx file.
  - pyttsx3 (fallback) -> wraps whatever robotic TTS the OS already has
                          (SAPI5 / NSSpeech / espeak-ng). Used only when no
                          Piper voice is installed, so Emma still talks even
                          on a bare machine.

Nothing here ever goes over the network once the voice model is on disk.

Backend selection (``engine``):
    "auto"     -> Piper if a voice model is available, else pyttsx3
    "piper"    -> Piper only (raises if unavailable)
    "pyttsx3"  -> the legacy system voice only

Design notes:
  - The Piper voice is loaded once and reused. Loading the ~60MB ONNX model
    on every utterance would add seconds of latency; onnxruntime inference
    is stateless per call, so a single cached voice is safe for Emma's
    sequential "speak one reply at a time" loop.
  - pyttsx3's engine, by contrast, is NOT safe to reuse across threads and
    hangs if .stop() races .runAndWait(), so that backend still builds a
    fresh engine per utterance - same as before.
  - Playback prefers sounddevice (in-process, no temp files). If there's no
    usable output device it falls back to the system `aplay`/`paplay`, so
    Emma stays audible across very different machines.
